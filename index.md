### Why we need it ?

* List features as told by Boxen's own homepage.
* Not everybody (even developers) will be in position to appreciate why those features matter. Explaining the importance of these in details. Providing more empirical proof and testimonials will help.

### Benefits

* Eventhough discussing each feature will imply discussing the benefits as well. A nice *list* of benefits will help us reinforce the idea and let them really root for it. Also, setting the charge and the pace and keep them interested for the entire presentation.
