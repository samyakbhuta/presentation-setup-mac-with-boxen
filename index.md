### But why we need tools ?


TODO: Write something for this slide. We are artist. Lest, we are humans. We are where we are cause of tool. May be a video. May be quotation.

The objective of this slide is to make sure audience understands why tooling is such an important thing.

### Why we need it ?

* List features as told by Boxen's own homepage.
* Not everybody (even developers) will be in position to appreciate why those features matter. Explaining the importance of these in details. Providing more empirical proof and testimonials will help.

### Benefits

* Eventhough discussing each feature will imply discussing the benefits as well. A nice *list* of benefits will help us reinforce the idea and let them really root for it. Also, setting the charge and the pace and keep them interested for the entire presentation.

### Underlying Opinion

> We believe that development is production, so we value consistency, predictability, and reproducibility over artisanal, hand-tweaked development environments.

###  Community

* Lots of [third party modules](https://github.com/boxen)
* Create your own modules and extend

### You know Puppet ?

* Boxen uses [Puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/)


### Let's start it

* Create a project manifest. Run a command. That's it.
